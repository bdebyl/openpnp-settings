# Description
The `.xml` files are used with my OpenPnP setup with stock LitePlacer and the
TinyG motion controller. Use as a reference if needed.

Firmware and TinyG settings have been provided in the sub-directory under
`tinyg/`. Instructions are present in the directory `README` files namely for
my ability to remember how to set this up, should I need to revisit this in the
future. :)
